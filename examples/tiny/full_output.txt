1. Result

A ranking was found that generates the correct outputs.

   Stratum #1
      *No Onset                                 *NoOns
      *Coda                                     *Coda
   Stratum #2
      Max(t)                                    Max
      Dep(?)                                    Dep

2. Tableaux


/a/: 
    *NoOns¦*Coda|Max¦Dep
>?a       ¦     |   ¦1  
 a    1!  ¦     |   ¦   


/tat/: 
     *NoOns¦*Coda|Max¦Dep
>ta        ¦     |1  ¦   
 tat       ¦ 1!  |   ¦   


/at/: 
     *NoOns¦*Coda|Max¦Dep
>?a        ¦     |1  ¦1  
 ?at       ¦ 1!  |   ¦1  
 a     1!  ¦     |1  ¦   
 at    1!  ¦ 1   |   ¦   


3. Status of Proposed Constraints:  Necessary or Unnecessary

   *NoOns  Necessary
   *Coda   Necessary
   Max     Not necessary (but included to show Faithfulness violations
              of a winning candidate)
   Dep     Not necessary (but included to show Faithfulness violations
              of a winning candidate)

A check has determined that the grammar will still work even if the 
constraints marked above as unnecessary are removed en masse.


4. Ranking Arguments, based on the Fusional Reduction Algorithm

This run sought to obtain the Skeletal Basis, intended to keep each final ranking argument as pithy as possible.



The final rankings obtained are as follows:

      *Coda >> Max
      *NoOns >> Dep


5. Mini-Tableaux

The following small tableaux may be useful in presenting ranking arguments. 
They include all winner-rival comparisons in which there is just one 
winner-preferring constraint and at least one loser-preferring constraint.  
Constraints not violated by either candidate are omitted.


/a/: 
    *NoOns|Dep
>?a       |1  
 a    1   |   


/tat/: 
     *Coda|Max
>ta       |1  
 tat  1   |   


/at/: 
     *Coda|Max¦Dep
>?a       |1  ¦1  
 ?at  1   |   ¦1  


/at/: 
    *NoOns|Max¦Dep
>?a       |1  ¦1  
 a    1   |1  ¦
